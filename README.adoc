I thought that this can be recurring problem so I've decided to look for a macro to speed things up. To set up the macro environment:

1. Get the macros plugin for visual studio
Search for "Macros for Visual Studio" or go to https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.MacrosforVisualStudio

Run the installer and apply to the Visual Studio version you're using.
I have included the installer at <link> in case the link becomes inaccessible.

2. Write a macro to reorder the directives.
Open Visual Studio, then go to Tools>Macros>Macro Explorer

Then create a new macro by right-clicking the Macro Browser List > New Macro. You can name macro whatever you want.

Open the macro by right-clicking on its name and selecting Open. Copy paste the macro from the file.
I have included the macro file at <link>.

3. Adjust Visual Studio preferences for using Directives


4. [Optional] Set up a hotkey for the macro


And now you are done! Run the macro whenever you need to. Just be warned that the macro is UI-based and currently loops through all files, so you might have to wait a while.
